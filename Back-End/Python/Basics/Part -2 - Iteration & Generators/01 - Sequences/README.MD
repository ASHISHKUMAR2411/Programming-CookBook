# Sequences
=======================


- []()

## Features

### Some methods supported by mutable sequence types such as lists


- l.clear()  *Removes all itesm from l*
- l.append(x) *appends x to the end of s*
- l.insert(i, x) *insert x at index i*
- l.extend(literable) *appends contents of iterable to end of l*
- l.pop(i) *removes **and** returns element of index i*
- l.remove(x) *removes firdst occurence of x in s*
- l.reverse() *does an in-place reversal of elements of s*
- l.copy() *returns a shallow copy*

### NOTES

Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Sequences

- *Strings are **homogeneous** sequences, each element is of the same type (a character).*

- *Lists are **heterogeneous** sequences, each element may be a different type.*

- [Constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding)

Constant folding and constant propagation are related compiler optimizations used by many modern compilers.[1] An advanced form of constant propagation known as sparse conditional constant propagation can more accurately propagate constants and simultaneously remove dead code.

- [Constant Folding](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-constant-folding.html)

Constant folding is an optimization technique that eliminates expressions that calculate a value that can already be determined before code execution. These are typically calculations that only reference constant values or expressions that reference variables whose values are constant.
